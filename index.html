                <p>Hello, my name is Natalie and I am passionate
                    about finding creative solutions that improve
                    digital experiences for everyone. To me design
                    is a world of opportunity to be creative and

                <h1>My Story</h1>
                <p>I’ve always had a passion for the arts and practiced traditional forms for as long 
                    as I can remember. I began to take an interest in digital mediums in the 
                    beginning of my college career, particularly film and graphic design. 
                    I took film classes at Austin Community College, where I became fascinated 
                    by the art of visual storytelling. I spent my weekends and time off learning 
                    the elements of graphic design and the industry standard softwares. 
                    I recently graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, where I studied Middle Eastern 
                    languages and cultures. For my senior year capstone project I composed my very first graphic 
                    design portfolio, a campaign about drug addiction and mental health in the Middle East. Ever 
                    since, my goal in life was to find a way to use creativity to help others. I discovered UX/ UI 
                    shortly after my graduation and the rest is history. I became fascinated by the research and 
                    problem-solving aspects of this multi-dimensional field, and how design decisions are centered 
                    on the user. In visual storytelling, you have something called the dramatic center, which is 
                    the driving force of the story. In UX/ UI, the user is the dramatic center and I design with 
                    this mantra in mind. After dabbing in InVision and several Youtube tutorials, I joined the University 
                    of Texas UX/ UI Bootcamp, where I learned about design processes and concepts and applied them to real 
                    world situations. I enjoy working on every stage of this iterative process, from UX research to front-end development.
